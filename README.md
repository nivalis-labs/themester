# Themester

Let's face it. As developers, many of us spend far too much time tweaking the
colour schemes of the various applications we use to make our living. And once
we find something we like, we want to have it everywhere.

Themester has the lofty (unobtainable?) goal to be a universal (or at least
application-agnostic) theme editor. It will provide some clever tools for
creating a theme that is the right fit for you, or modify a theme made by
someone else to fit you better. And when you are happy with the result, it will
help you to generate matching themes for all of your favourite applications
(and perhaps even install them).

It is currently in early development and can do none of the above.
